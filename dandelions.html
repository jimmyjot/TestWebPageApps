                    is a large genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. They are native
                    to Eurasia and North and South America, and two species, T. officinale and
                    T. erythrospermum, are found as weeds worldwide. Both species are edible in
                    their entirety. The common name <span class="pronounce"><strong>dandelion</strong>
                    <em>/'dandiali&#x0259;n/</em></span> (from French dent-de-lion, meaning 'lion's tooth') is 
                    given to members of the genus, and like other members of the Asteraceae family,
                    they have very small flowers collected together into a composite flower head. 
                    Each single flower in a head is called a floret Many <em>Taraxacum</em> species
                    produce seeds asexually by apomixis, where the seeds are produced without pollination,
                    resulting in offspring that are genetically identical to the parent plant.
